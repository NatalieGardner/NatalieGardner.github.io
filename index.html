  			<hr color="#525f3b">
  			<p> 
			I am a senior Technical Writing and Communication Major pursuing the Information Technology and Design subplan at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities graduating in December 2020. I am passionate about getting information to the people who need it in ways that are engaging and easy to understand. I am very interested in the medical industry; I find satisfaction in knowing that I am improving the lives of patients by ensuring necessary information is clear and accessible to them. <br> <br>
This past summer, I obtained an internship at Cretex Medical which strengthened my interest in the medical industry. One of the major projects I worked on was the launch of their new company website. I wrote content for the main, secondary, and tertiary pages including case studies and white papers about various medical devices and manufacturing processes. <br> <br>
I am very detail-oriented and am able to obtain a deep understanding of complex information quickly and translate that information into simple, user-friendly content. Through course work in the Writing Studies department, the Dean’s First Year Research and Creative Scholar’s Program, and multiple internship experiences, I have a proven ability to research, find data, and compile it in a way that is engaging, easy to understand, and meets the needs of target audiences. I have developed excellent written and verbal communication skills with demonstrated writing experience. I am a looking forward to learning more about the field of technical writing and communication, the medical industry, and about how to create content that is accessible, understandable, and enjoyable.
